PhishCheck - a fun, interactive way to test and improve your phishing awareness!

Here is a short instruction in how to run the application:

1. Install the Expo App, either from Google Play Store or Apple App Store
2. After installing the Expo app, run "npx expo start" (npx expo start --tunnel also works, especially if having issues with networking)
3. Scan the QR code provided after running "npx expo start"
4. Now you're in! :)

Remember that it takes roughly 30 seconds for the backend to startup.
